# Hypotenuse-Calculation-and-Custom-Computation
This repository demonstrates my incremental development skills, including a function to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem. It also includes a custom computation function, showcasing problem-solving abilities. Each function was developed step-by-step for efficient debugging and testing.
